## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Go into project's root directory, and run the command `npm install`.
3. Run the test suite using the command `npm test`.
If the command `npm test` does not work, you may need to install Mocha globally on your machine. Do this with the command npm `npm install -g mocha`.

## What we learned working on this project
- I learned how to use Chai's assertion syntax for unit tests.
